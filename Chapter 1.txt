Introduction (Overview):

This course provides a comprehensive overview of how the backend of an application works. 
It covers all the essential fundamentals every Backend Engineer must know. 
Throughout the program, we will dive into key concepts and learn about several important 
areas, including:

1. Fundamentals of backend engineering
2. Backend communication design patterns
3. How backend communication protocols work
4. Comprehend how OS Kernel communicate with Backend Applications
5. Operating System fundamentals (Thread, Process, async IO in linux)
6. HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3
7. Learn gRPC, WebRTC, WebSockets
7. Learn TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3, QUIC 0RTT

We will even talk about UDP, TCP, the bare bone that pretty much everything is 
built on top of those two. We will figure out how everything works under the hood.
We will remove the idea of abstractions and will see how everything is executing.

And when we understand how things work, if things broke, if we are seeing a performance
latency, if we are seeing some degradation, if we are seeing a bug, then by understanding
how things work we can immediately understand where the problem is and how can we fix it.

We will also talk about Backend execution style. It's like once the request actually received
in the Backend, how is the connection being accepted? How does the Kernel, the OS, moves the
connection to the backend applications.

How does application reads the request, even we will see what is the request?
It's just a bunch of bytes, but the work that the application has to do to understand what 
request is, is it trivial or non-trivial and understanding the cost as being consumed on 
all of these layers and then up until the request arrives in your event so that an on 
request event is being triggered.
