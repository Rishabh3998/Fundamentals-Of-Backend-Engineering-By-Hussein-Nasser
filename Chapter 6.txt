4. Short Polling (Request is taking a while, I'll check with you later)

When people say polling they usually refer to short polling, and the idea of why we call short polling is because
it just takes a very quick time to poll, like is this thing done or not? that's it, it just keep asking questions
after a `t` interval of time and this `t` is very small.

So, usually short polling is very common when you have a request that takes a long time to process and we want to
execute it asynchronously on the backend.

Where request / response is not ideal:

1. A request takes long time to process
   - Upload a youtube video

2. The backend want to send notification (In this case polling is not a good idea but we can use it)
   - A user just logged in 

Note: If the backend has an event that happened, we want to know that this event is either a push or a pull, can work
a request / response does not work in this particular case.

3. Polling is a very good communication style



## What is Short polling?

- Client sends a request

- Server immediately responds with a handle (this handle is in a form of unique identifier that corresponds to the request)
and the backend is free to do whatever it can do here, like it can queue, it can persist through some sort of a disk, it can
put it in memory and then later execute the request. So, the request is not executed immediately in this particular case, but
you can check later for progress.

- Server continues to process the request maybe or pick it up later, and then the client uses that handle to check for status
and it will pull for the status [it this thing ready?, is this thing ready?, ...], short refers to the immediate quick response.

Note: So, technically it is a request / response when you look at the polling from the narrow angle, the idea of making the 
"poll" is the request / response.

- Multiple "short" request response as polls (we broke down one big request / response into multiple request which will give
a status).

But the whole system is based on this asynchronous execution with short polling.

According to the image diagram of short polling present in images folder, at some point request actually technically finished.
We only delivered the response when the request actually was completed. So, the next poll will actually have immediately the 
response in that particular case.



## Short polling Pros and cons:

- Pros:
  - Simple to implement
  - Good for long running request ( if we have request that takes a long time to actually execute, make it a polling system)
  - Client can disconnect safely

- Cons:
  - Too chatty (After scaling too much polls can adds up, network is gonna be congested due to lot of requests)
  - Kills our Network Bandwidth, network bandwidth for Backend is very crucial, because if we put everything too the cloud, 
  that's how we get billed.
  - Wasted backend resources.


Note: The cost is the networking cost in short polling, a better approach would be to use kafka. It's called long polling.
